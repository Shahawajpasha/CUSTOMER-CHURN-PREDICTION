---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project predicts customer churn for a telecom company using machine learning. Churn prediction helps companies reduce customer loss and improve retention by identifying customers likely to leave.

---

## 📊 Dataset Information

- **Source**: IBM Sample Dataset
- **File**: `WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv`
- **Records**: 7,043 customer entries
- **Features**: Customer demographics, account details, services used, churn status

---

## 💡 Key Objectives

- Understand customer churn patterns through EDA
- Preprocess and clean the dataset
- Build multiple classification models
- Evaluate and compare model performance
- Visualize trends and important features

---

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies

- Python 🐍  
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab 📓  
- Libraries:  
  - `pandas`, `numpy`  
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn`  
  - `scikit-learn`

---

## 🧪 Machine Learning Models Used

- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree Classifier  
- Random Forest Classifier  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  

✅ Model Evaluation:
- Accuracy Score
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report

---

## 📈 Visualizations

- Pie chart of churn distribution
- Histograms and count plots
- Heatmap of feature correlations
- Box plots for numerical insights
